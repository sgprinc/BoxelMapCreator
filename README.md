# BoxelMapCreator
Unity project for a boxel map creator plus interconnection with the Google Poly 3D asset service.


Note that a big mayority of the code being tracked in this repository are the Google Poly, Poly, Poly Toolkit and GitHub-Unity libraries, which the default Unity ignore file does not remove to avoid broken references. I have neither authored nor claim any credit for these libraries.

Note that to run an API Key from Google Poly will have to be obtained.
